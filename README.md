# Smoke-Detection-Using-ANN
The dataset used to create this model is public dataset collected via sensors from various fire alarms.
The data is cleaned to remove the existing outliers using the IQR (Inter-Quartile Range) Method.
The processed data is then used to create an ANN model using the TensorFlow Library.
